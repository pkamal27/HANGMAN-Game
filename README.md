# HANGMAN-Game

I have created Hangman game using Python3.
you can find rules and see how it works from following link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)"

It is MVP of Hangman.

I have made it only for 2 players and only work with single word.
(It is not allowing multiplayers. It will not work for sentence or phrase)
I have not used any UI to show the game, it will work fully on terminal.
